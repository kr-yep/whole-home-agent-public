# Current capability status

**Checkpoint:** M34 normal STOP · **Runtime:** `OPERATE DISABLED` · **Production ready:** no

This page is updated with every milestone push so a teammate can see what is usable and
what is still missing without reconstructing the full experiment history.

## Usable now

- Install the public Python package from this repository on Python 3.11–3.14.
- Run deterministic B0 semantic fixtures and receive scoped, evidence-bound answers.
- Run one closed, project-owned, prerecorded synthetic key→bag→sofa replay locally.
- Use either compact JSON CLI output or the closed Streamlit demo; neither accepts an
  upload, camera, arbitrary path, chat prompt, credential, or action handle.
- Inspect top-level answer `subject_id`, status, location, epistemic state, replay scope,
  as-of sequence, claim IDs, and relation path.
- Rebuild the same B0 claim ledger/projection; the golden semantic SHA-256 remains
  `226d30a5b826720d607d0b9a29bf3dfb9f5429eeedbbd70ffd1ff23c21233c8f`.
- Run the public test/CI matrix and mechanical release audit.

## Still missing before a credible hackathon handoff

- An independent teammate/platform clean-install and 90-second/CLI-fallback demo drill;
  one agent-run Windows clean clone/install/offline CLI path now works mechanically.
- Protected-group development plus untouched-test evidence for real indoor small-object
  detection; one synthetic fixture and one tiny YCB-V smoke target are insufficient.
- A tracker that survives occlusion and camera motion strongly enough for movement-event
  work; the current VOST target path was rejected on development.
- A product-level recorded indoor relation replay beyond project-generated artwork.
- Clear packaging/recovery evidence on each teammate platform.

## Deliberately not available

- Live camera, RTSP, background recording, multi-camera identity, face recognition, or
  audio capture.
- Durable household memory, private-data search, retention/deletion controls, cloud
  inference, device control, purchases, messages, or physical action.
- Any claim of 24/7 readiness, real-home accuracy, general home understanding, or
  safety-critical behavior.

These remain blocked by proposed governance, unassigned roles, absent consent and data
policy, and `OPERATE DISABLED`.

## Latest push: M34 retry result

The one allowed retry parsed uv correctly, made a new public clone, installed 40 locked
packages from an empty cache, and ran the unchanged demo offline. It returned the exact
scoped key→bag→sofa result in 30.427 seconds total with zero demo network attempts.

The contract still stopped: Windows `core.autocrlf` converted the text lock from LF to
CRLF, so its raw working-tree hash differed while the Git blob and `uv sync --frozen`
remained exact. The agent-run Windows path is mechanically usable; independent teammate
and other-platform evidence is still missing. M35 may fix text identity only and cannot
rerun M34.
